<p>Simple demo of Enterprise with Janrain SSO.</p>

<p>Setting up Janrain SSO requires a few core steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Add SSO settings.</li>
    <li>Include a Cross Domain Receiver page.</li>
    <li>Implement additional SSO event hooks (see janrain-init.js)</li>
    <li>Implement a logout page (see: <a target="_blank" href="logged-out.html">this page</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Settings and examples for all of these will be provided to you by your Janrain Tech Lead during deployment.
</p>

<p>
In order to test SSO here, you can try <a target="_blank" href="http://ec2-54-210-170-95.compute-1.amazonaws.com/">this page</a>, 
which sits on a different domain but points to the same Janrain Enterprise instance and has the same SSO configuration. 
You'll see that signing in or signing out from either page on either domain will have the parallel effect on the other. Be
sure to view the Javascript console for more helpful information.
