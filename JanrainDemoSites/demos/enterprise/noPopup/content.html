<p>This demo shows how the Identity Provider permission screens can also be shown
in "full-screen" mode if that is preferred.</p>

<p>To test more than once you will need to force the IDPs to "forget" your permissions for this site.
    <br>(example for Facebook: <a target="_new" href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications" class="ui-link">https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications</a>)
    <br>(example for Google: <a target="_new" href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions" class="ui-link">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions</a>)
    <br><br>In both pages, find our test application ("janrain-se-demo") and remove it.
