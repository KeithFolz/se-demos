<p>This is a simple demo of Janrain Enterprise with Backplane enabled.</p>

<p>
Normally, Backplane is used to let two or more widgets on the same page communicate with each other over a common protocol. In
this demo, Janrain Enterprise will play the role of one of those widgets, but the demo will simply show the Backplane
events and messages flowing over the Backplane bus. This bus is what a second widget on the page would be also listening
on and reacting to.

<p>
Note that this demo is based on the Backplane 1.2 specification. For more details, see:<br>
