<p>This demo shows how easy it is to add Google Analytics to a Janrain 
    Enterprise-enabled page and track event data around signin and registration.</p>
        
<div id="user_activities" style="display:none">

    <p>We also include some simple non Janrain Enterprise items in the page to show how GA can be used for Janrain's events as well as your own.</p>

    <p><a href="" id="user_activity_1">activity 1</a></p>
    <p><a href="" id="user_activity_2">activity 2</a></p>
    <p><a href="" id="user_activity_3">activity 3</a></p>
    <p><a href="" id="user_activity_4">activity 4</a></p>

    <p>Please contact your contact at Janrain for a tour of the GA back-end where the analytics data can be viewed.</p>
