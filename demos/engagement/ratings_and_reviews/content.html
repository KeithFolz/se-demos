<p>This is a demo of Janrain Engagement with <b>Ratings and Reviews</b>.</p>

<p>

Empower customers to rate and review products or content across your sites.
Create social proof by enabling customers to become advocates.
Define sub-categories for customers to rate, and sort reviews based on
chronology, number of ratings, most liked or most active.
Reviews are fully integrated with social networks, SEO-friendly, responsive
for mobile, and include extensive filtering and moderation tools.
<br><br>
Ratings and Review instances can easily be provisioned automatically with the creation
of new pages and/or products.
<br><br>
Try out these features on this example implementation:
<ul>
  <li>After signing into site, you are also signed into ratings and reviews</li>
  <li>Like a review</li>
  <li>Comment on a review</li>
  <li>Share review to Facebook and Twitter (if logged in with that IDP)</li>
  <li>Dirty word filter prevents offensive posts</li>
  <li>Reviews added on this page also show in Site Activity Feed</li>
</ul>

Coming Soon:
<ul>
  <li>Review sort order choices</li>
  <li>Users can delete their own reviews</li>
</ul>
